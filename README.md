# Conflicting Tailwind CSS Utility Classes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS involving conflicting utility classes. The bug arises when using classes that have contradictory styles, leading to unexpected visual results.

## Bug Description:
The bug occurs when applying multiple Tailwind CSS classes that have conflicting styles or properties. For example, applying `float-left` and `float-right` simultaneously, or `text-left` and `text-right`. Tailwind's specificity rules may not always resolve the conflict as expected.  This can lead to unpredictable visual results and layout issues.

## Steps to Reproduce:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the application (if applicable).
3. Observe the unexpected behavior in the specified section of the code.

## Solution:
The solution involves carefully reviewing the applied Tailwind classes to identify and resolve conflicts. This might involve removing redundant classes, using more specific classes, or employing the `!important` flag (though this should be used sparingly).  This repository provides a corrected version that eliminates the conflict.
